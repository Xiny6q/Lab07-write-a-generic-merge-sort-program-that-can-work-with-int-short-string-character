# Lab07-write-a-generic-merge-sort-program-that-can-work-with-int-short-string-character
Lab07 write a generic merge sort program that can work with int, short, string, character
In this lab, you are required to write a generic merge sort program that can work with int, short, string, character and two sample structs. A linked list data structure is used to store data throughout the lab.

A skeleton lab7.c program is provided with the main function. The entire main function will be replaced by my own main function when grading. Refer to the comments in the file.

The run command will be

./<name of executable>

There are no corner cases in this lab.

Restrictions

Do NOT add any printf function. When I run your submission, it should not output anything. If the program outputs anything when grading, it will automatically get 0. No regrades in this case no matter what. Even if you spend countless hours in this lab and everything works in your code, making anything print in this lab will result in 0. I will not accept any regrade request in this category.

Do NOT change any function signatures of the given functions. You are allowed to have your own helper function, but my grading program will only use the provided functions. It will get 0 if you don’t follow and same lengthy explanation and reasoning as above.

Grading

Make sure to test against those to ensure that your program output format works. Any grading failure due to not following specifications will result in 0. For full marks this week, you must:

(1 point) Correctly submit A number file

(1 point) Not having any files in github other than lab7.c and AXXXX.txt

(3 point) Generate a correct solution (including correct memory allocation and deallocation) to the problem(s) in this lab

Submission Files

You must deliver only one .c file named: lab7.c (do not capitalize)

AXXXX.txt (empty file, but with your A number as file name. Make sure to include 0’s, match this A number with your A number in learning hub, and have .txt extension)
